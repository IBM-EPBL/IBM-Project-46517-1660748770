Our Project Description:
   During the COVID 19 crisis, the requirement of plasma became a high priority and the donor count has become low.
Saving the donor information and helping the needy by notifying the current donors list, would be a helping hand.
Idea:
   The user interacts with the application.
Register by giving the details such as name, email Id, location, etc., of a donor.
The database will have all the details and if a user posts a request then the concerned blood group donors will get notified about it.
Solution:
   Reduce the death risk due to the plasma scarecity.
Increase the plasma donors.
User friendly.
